# Color Interactions

This is the source code for a collection of interactive exercises that explore different phenomena of color. The exercises are loosely based on ones present in [Josef Albers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albers)â€™s renowned book, [Interaction of Color](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300179354/interaction-color). This site exists as a non-profit, educational resource.

## Getting Started

These are rough guidelines on how to get this running locally on your computer.

### Prerequisites

You will need node and npm accessible in your cli. You can get those here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


### Installing

Clone or download this respository and then within it, run
```
npm i
```

Once things have finished installing, runs the following command to get a local server started:
```
npm run dev
```

Then visit `localhost:8080` and you're good to go!


## Building production-ready files

Running `npm run build` will create a `dist/` directory with an `index.html`, `bundle.js`, and `bundle.js.map/` (the source maps).

## Built With

## Random thoughts

* Does this need Redux? Absolutely not, but work was picking it up and I needed to brush up on it.
* The JS is messy! I was rushing to get an MVP out the door and an end-of-the-year deadline snuck up on me.
* Yes, I know I don't have tests.
* Yes, the CSS is messy. I was playing around with a [BEM CSS](http://getbem.com/introduction/) approach for a while and then realized I have a very shallow understanding of it.
